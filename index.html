    <h4>WHO CREATED IT?</h4>
    <p>Sir Tim Berners-Lee designed HTML in the early 1990s at CERN, a nuclear physics laboratory in Switzerland</p>
    <h5>HOW ITS USE?</h5>
    <p>HTML is the basic scripting language that web browsers use to render web pages. It's often used with other technologies, such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript.</p>
    <h6>PROS AND CONS:</h6>
    <p>HTML is relatively easy to learn, open source, and free to use. However, it's primarily used for static websites, and it has some limitations when it comes to fully responsive components. </p>

     <center> <h1 style="color: navy;"><b><i><U>MY FAVOURITE DESTINATION</U></i></b></h1>
      <img src="./asset/islamabad 1.jpeg" alt="islamabad" height="10%" width="30%"></center>
      <h1 style="color: blue;"><b><i><u>Introduction of Islamabad :</u></i></b></h1>
      <p>Islamabad is located at the edge of the Pothohar Plateau at the foot of the Margalla Hills. Its elevation is 507 metres (1,663 ft).The modern capital and the ancient Gakhar city of Rawalpindi stand side by side and are commonly referred to as the Twin Cities.To the east of the city lies Murree and Kotli Sattian.
           To the north lies the Haripur District of Khyber Pakhtunkwah Province.  Kahuta lies on the northeast, Taxila, Wah Cantt, and Attock District to the northwest, Gujar Khan, Kallar Syedian, Rawat, and Mandrah on the northeast, and Rawalpindi to the southwest.
      Islamabad is located 120 kilometres (75 mi) SSW of Muzaffarabad, 185 kilometres (115 mi) east of Peshawar, 295 kilometres (183 mi) NNE of Lahore, and 300 kilometres (190 mi) WSW of Srinagar, the capital of Indian Kashmir.
      A relatively quiet city, Islamabad consists of mainly Federal Government offices, Parliment House, the official residences of the President and Prime Minister along with the Diplomatic Enclave, an area next to the Parliament House dedicated to foreign embassies and missions appointed in Pakistan.
      Islamabad has a population of 1.21 million as of 2009. Urdu is predominantly spoken within the city due to the ethnic mix of populations. English, being the official language of Pakistan, is also commonly understood. Other languages include Punjabi, Pashto and Pothohari.
       Although the majority of the population in Islamabad traditionally have been employees of the Federal Government. In the last decade there have been vast changes in the city’s traditional reputation. From it being a typical 9 to 5 city, Islamabad has become more lively with many new restaurants and hotels springing up to service this new wealth.
        A lot of international food chains have opened, and generally a great improvement in night life with increasing shopping areas opening till late. However during winter season streets are considerably quiet after dark.
      Islamabad has attracted people from all over Pakistan, making it the most cosmopolitan city in the country. As the capital city it has hosted a number of important meetings, such as the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation summit. Even now, Islamabad remains a city where people come from all over the country to enjoy its peaceful,
       noise-free atmosphere with a lot of greenery and nice surrounding scenery. It also serves as a base camp for people from the south and coastal areas like Karachi visiting valleys like Swat and Kaghan and northern areas like Gilgit, Hunza, Skardu and Chitral located in the Himalayas mountains.
      <h1 style="color: blue;"><b><i>Attractions Of Islamabad :</i></b></h1>
      <p><span style="color: darkgreen;">Its a good idea to avoid taking photographs of military establishments, police stations and anyone in uniform (army officers wear khaki, naval officers wear white, and the Islamabad police wear navy blue trousers with a light blue shirt). If in doubt, permission can be requested from the officers concerned.
          The main administrative authority of the city is Islamabad Capital Territory Administration (ICT) with some help from Capital Development Authority (CDA) which oversees the planning, development, construction, and administration of the city.
          Islamabad Capital Territory is divided into eight zones: Administrative Zone, Commercial District, Educational Sector, Industrial Sector, Diplomatic Enclave, Residential Areas, Rural Areas and Green Area. Islamabad city is divided into five major zones: Zone I, Zone II, Zone III, Zone IV, and Zone V. Out of these, Zone IV is the largest in area.
           Zone I consists mainly of all the developed residential sectors while Zone II consists of the under-developed residential sectors. Zone III consists primarily of the Margalla Hills and Margalla Hills National Park. Rawal Lake is in this zone. Zone IV and V consist of Islamabad Park, and rural areas of the city. The Soan River flows into the city through Zone V. 
           The sectors are lettered from A to I, and each sector is divided into four numbered sub-sectors.
          The F and G series contains the most developed sectors. F-5 is an important sector for the software industry in Islamabad, as the two software technology parks are located here. The entire F-9 sector is covered with Fatima Jinnah Park. The Centaurus complex will be one of the major landmarks of the F-8 sector. G sectors are numbered G-5 through G-17. 
          Some important places include the Jinnah Convention Center and Serena Hotel in G-5, the Red Mosque in G-6, and the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, the largest medical complex in the capital, located in G-8.
          Combination of modernity and old Islamic and regional traditions. The Saudi Pak Tower is an example of the integration of modern architecture with traditional styles. The beige-coloured edifice is trimmed with blue tile works in Islamic tradition, and is one of Islamabad’s tallest buildings. The Saudi Pak Tower is an office building.
           It comprises 19 floors where more than a dozen multinational companies are operating, including European companies and multinational companies from Chinese and Middle Eastern region. Other examples of intertwined Islamic and modern architecture include Pakistan Monument and Faisal Mosque.</p></span>
  <h1 style="color:blue;"><b><i><u>Faisal Mosque :</u></i></b></h1><img src="./asset/download.jpeg" alt="faisal mosque" height="10%" width="10%">Islamabad’s most recognizable landmark, a very large mosque gifted by King Faisal of Saudi Arabia. This is why the city is called to home to the famous Faisal Mosque,
   the largest mosque in South Asia and the sixth largest mosque in the world. Faisal Masjid is Beautiful in the day or night, definitely worth the short taxi ride. Dress and act respectfully, this is much more a place of serious worship than a tourist site.

  <h1 style="color: blue;"><b><i><u>Pakistan Monument :</u></i></b></h1><img src="./asset/monument 2.jpeg" alt="Pakistan Monument" height="10%" width="10%" align="right">
  <p>Represents Pakistan’s four provinces and three territories. From air the monument looks like a star (center) and a crescent moon (formed by walls forming the petals), these represent the star and crescent on Pakistan’s flag. After a competition among many renowned architects,
       Arif Masood’s plan was selected for the final design. The blooming flower shape of the monument represents Pakistan’s progress as a rapidly developing country. The four main petals of the monument represent the four provinces (Balochistan, North West Frontier Province, Punjab, and Sindh),
        while the three smaller petals represent the Northern Areas, Azad Kashmir and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. The Monument has been designed to reflect the culture and civilization of the country and depicts the story of the Pakistan Movement, dedicated to those who sacrificed themselves for future generations.</p><br>

  <h1 style="color: blue;"><b><i><u>Margalla Hills :</u></i></b></h1>
  <img src="./asset/margalla hills.jpeg" alt="Margalla Hills" height="10%" width="10%">
  <p>Margalla Hills National Park, is located in the foothills of the Himalayan range. The topography is rugged, with numerous valleys and many steep and even precipitous slopes. The area is drained by the River Kurang and its tributaries, which flow into the River Soan.
       This park is the most accessible park in Pakistan due to its close proximity to the national capital, Islamabad. A visitor centre is planned for Daman-E-Koh, providing lounge accommodation and an information service. Lodges, camping grounds and picnic sites are also planned and the provision of a chair lift may be considered.
        Take a nice nature walk in the hills surrounding Islamabad.</p>

  <h1 style="color: blue;"><b><i><u>Blue Area :</u></i></b></h1>
  <p>Blue Area is Islamabad’s financial center and is the main arterial road which leads up to the main government buildings at the Constitution Avenue. The Blue Area is the commercial and business hub of Islamabad, Pakistan. It is called the “Blue Area” because it was represented in a colour blue in the original design of the planned city.
       The area is actually a corridor that runs along Islamabad’s Khayaban-e-Quaid-e-Azam, Islamabad’s<img src="./asset/blue area.jpeg" alt="Blue Area" height="10%" width="10%"> primary arterial road which leads up to the main government buildings. The Blue Area has recently received a significant amount of foreign direct investment. Recently, construction began on The Centaurus, 
       a multi-purpose complex in the Blue Area which will include residential and office towers, and a luxury hotel. There are many tall skyscrapers in blue area. It is characterized by clean.</p>

  <center><h1 style="color: blue;"><b><i><u>Jinnah Avenue :</u></i></b></h1> 
  <img src="./asset/jinnah avenue.jpeg" alt="Jinnah Avenue" height="20%" width="20%"></center>
  <p>Fatima Jinnah Park or sometimes known as F-9 park (the covered area is spread out through the entire F-9 sector) is a public recreational park situated in sector F-9 of Islamabad. The park is considered one of the largest in South East Asia. It was named after the revered (Mother of the Nation) Miss Fatima Jinnah- younger sister of the founder of Pakistan Mohammad Ali Jinnah.
       Micheal Japero was the builder of Fatima Park. It took him five years to come up with the design.
    Its colossal acreage is covered mostly by greenery with few man-made structures dotting the landscape. With the exception of a few areas of the park that are close to residential districts, most of the park area effectively serves as a wildlife sanctuary. The park is bounded by a steel fence with entrance doors at regular intervals, though only a few are routinely open and used.
     A further strip of land outside of the fence is lined with a foot trail. There is a well laid network of foot paths inside the park, with neat grass and a few statues erected sparsely; perhaps Fatima Jinnah Park is to Islamabad what Central Park is to New York City. The familiar scent of air and the sight of the Shaheen (Hawk) swooping down on its prey would all be gone once the technological advancements are brought in.
      Bird-watching in the park is like watching a wild life documentary in live.
    Fatima Jinnah Park is constructed in small clusters at the moment; some parts are well developed and a favorite among people while others are hardly ever tread upon. One of such areas is the “Megazone” complex. It is a well built area which has a lot to offer to its customers. The sports area comprises a standard length swimming pool, table tennis tables and snooker. While the more contemporary activities include bowling bowl,
     arcade games, laser tag and other small games. There is a take away and dining area as well. And lastly there is an assortment of different shops on clothes, DVDs and other accessories.</p>

            I am passionate about technology, creativity, and entrepreneurship. As
            someone with a background in digital marketing, web development, and
            graphic design, I thrive on creating innovative solutions that help
            businesses grow in the digital landscape. My journey started with a deep
            interest in web development, where I honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and
            TypeScript, and it has expanded into eCommerce, where I now manage
            Shopify stores and provide SEO services. I’m always eager to explore new
            trends and technologies that push the boundaries of digital
            possibilities. Whether it’s designing visually appealing interfaces or
            developing optimized content, I aim to make a meaningful impact in every
            project I take onstyle="align-items:right;">

            Outside of work, I enjoy continuous learning and experimenting with
            different projects. I love staying updated on the latest trends in tech,
            which fuels my desire to innovate. My mission is to empower individuals
            and businesses to succeed online by offering creative solutions and
            technical expertise

    A portfolio can help you showcase your skills and abilities to potential employers, which can lead to internships, scholarships, or job opportunities. It can also help you keep track of your accomplishments and document when you acquired key competencies. 
Freelance work
A portfolio is essential for freelancers because it's the first thing a potential client will see when they want to get to know your work. 
Investment planning
Portfolio planning helps organizations ensure they're making the right investments. It involves looking at incoming and running investments from multiple perspectives, such as financials, priority, and impact on resources. 
Portfolio management
Portfolio management allows you to diversify your investments across different asset classes, sectors, and regions. This can help ensure that the rest of your portfolio remains unaffected if one investment sinks. 
Self-reflection and confidence
A portfolio can help you develop self-reflection and boost your confidence. It can be a measure and guide to your professional accomplishments.  …</div>
